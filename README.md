- Got introduced to various Model deployment frameworks and API such as Flask, Heroku, and Streamlit.
- Successfully completed an end-to-end machine learning project from data cleaning to model deployment using Streamlit for the ”Used Car Price Prediction” project.
-  Had a great time managing a group project that employed Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques such as Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering for a customer segmentation project.


## Projects
**For my new project please check out my GitHub profile:** [My GitHub Page](https://github.com/atakanozdin)
### Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Circle Tracking (_Python, OpenCV, Argparse, PyMavlink_)
[Project source code](https://github.com/atakanozdin/UAV_Circle_Tracking)

A deep learning model was developed with OpenCV algorithms so that the fully autonomous underwater vehicle can find and pass the circle under the water with the help of its camera. The model was trained with circle images and the model score was %89 success.


### Fully Autonomy Maze Solving Robot (_C, C++, PIC16F_)
[Project source code](https://github.com/atakanozdin/mazeSolvingRobot)

A maze-solving robot that was developed to compete in the 12th METU Robot Olympics, which autonomously finds its way in the maze with its 2 motors and 3 distance sensors.


### Flight Ticket Price Prediction (_Python, Jupyter Lab, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, XGBoost_)
[Project source code](https://github.com/atakanozdin/Flight_Price_Project)

A machine learning model was developed that predicts airfare prices based on data from airports in Asian countries. The model was trained with 35 features, estimation was done with Regression Algorithms. The ML Model achieved %93 learning success and %87 learning success.


### NLP Classification & Sentiment Analysis (_Python, Jupyter Lab, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, BeautifulSoup_)
[Project source code](https://github.com/atakanozdin/NLP_Restaurant)

Reviews about a restaurant were found on Yelp.com. According to the star values given to these comments, 3 groups were formed as good, normal and bad. The most common words in the groups were shown in the word cloud by using Sentiment Analysis.


### Customer Segmentation K-Means (_Python, Jupyter Lab, Scikit-Learn Clustering, Seaborn, NumPy_)
[Project source code](https://github.com/atakanozdin/Customer-Segmentation)

An AI Model created with K-Means Clustering algorithms according to the frequency, recency, and money of the products sold in a market. How many clusters should be determined by the Silhouette Method and clustering was done with K-Means. Clusters were created according to the expenditures and %86 success was achieved.


### Wind Turbines Energy Production Forecasting (_Python, VS Code, Pandas, XGBoost, ARIMA, Streamlit_)
[Private project]

Hourly data from the sites where the wind turbines are located were analyzed. A Time Series Regression model was established with ARIMA and XGBoost, and a model was developed that predicts production for each hour of the following days. The ML web app was created with Streamlit.
